This folder contains copies of third-party software.
These packages may be either included in the source
code tarball or downloaded on-the-fly during compilation
as needed.  In some cases, some small customizations
are made to avoid namespace conflicts where the
included third party software needs workarounds for
issues on platforms (OS or compiler related) to
function consistently with LAMMPS.

The following software source packages are included
