Description
"""""""""""

.. versionadded:: TBD

This fix performs Monte-Carlo (MC) evaluations to enable kinetic
Monte Carlo (kMC)-type behavior during MD simulation by allowing
neighboring atoms to swap their positions. In contrast to the :doc:`fix
atom/swap <fix_atom_swap>` command which swaps pairs of atoms anywhere
in the simulation domain, the restriction of the MC swapping to
neighbors enables a hybrid MD/kMC-like simulation.

Neighboring atoms are defined by using a Voronoi tesselation performed
by the :doc:`compute voronoi/atom <compute_voronoi_atom>` command.
Two atoms are neighbors if their Voronoi cells share a common face
(3d) or edge (2d).

The selection of a swap neighbor is made using a distance-based
criterion for weighting the selection probability of each swap, in the
same manner as kMC selects a next event using relative probabilities.
The acceptance or rejection of each swap is determined via the
Metropolis criterion after evaluating the change in system energy due
to the swap.

A detailed explanation of the original implementation of this
algorithm can be found in :ref:`(Tavenner 2023) <TavennerMDkMC>`
where it was used to simulated accelerated diffusion in an MD context.

Simulating inherently kinetically-limited behaviors which rely on rare
events (such as atomic diffusion in a solid) is challenging for
traditional MD since its relatively short timescale will not naturally
sample many events. This fix addresses this challenge by allowing rare
neighbor hopping events to be sampled in a kMC-like fashion at a much
faster rate (set by the specified *N* and *X* parameters).  This enables
the processes of atomic diffusion to be approximated during an MD
simulation, effectively decoupling the MD atomic vibrational timescale
and the atomic hopping (kMC event) timescale.

The algorithm implemented by this fix is as follows:

   - The MD simulation is paused every *N* steps
   - A Voronoi tesselation is performed for the current atom configuration.
   - Then *X* atom swaps are attempted, one after the other.
   - For each swap, an atom *I* is selected randomly from the list of
     atom types specified by either the *types* or *diff* keywords.
   - One of *I*'s Voronoi neighbors *J* is selected using the
     distance-weighted probability for each neighbor detailed below.
   - The *I,J* atom IDs are communicated to all processors so that a
     global energy evaluation can be performed for the post-swap state
     of the system.
   - The swap is accepted or rejected based on the Metropolis criterion
     using the energy change of the system and the specified temperature
     *T*.

Here are a few comments on the computational cost of the swapping
algorithm.

   1. The cost of a global energy evaluation is similar to that of an MD
      timestep.

   2. Similar to other MC algorithms in LAMMPS, improved parallel
      efficiency is achieved with a smaller number of atoms per
      processor than would typically be used in an standard MD
      simulation. This is because the per-energy evaluation cost
      increases relative to the balance of MD/MC steps as indicated by
      1., but the communication cost remains relatively constant for a
      given number of MD steps.

   3. The MC portion of the simulation will run dramatically slower if
      the pair style uses different cutoffs for different atom types (or
      type pairs).  This is because each atom swap then requires a
      rebuild of the neighbor list to ensure the post-swap global energy
      can be computed correctly.

Limitations are imposed on selection of *I,J* atom pairs to avoid
swapping of atoms which are outside of a reasonable cutoff (e.g. due to
a Voronoi tesselation near free surfaces) though the use of a
distance-weighted probability scaling.

----------

This section gives more details on other arguments and keywords.

The random number generator (RNG) used by all the processors for MC
operations is initialized with the specified *seed*.

The distance-based probability is weighted by the specified *R0* which
sets the radius :math:`r_0` in this formula

.. math::

    p_{ij} = e^{(\frac{r_{ij}}{r_0})^2}

where :math:`p_{ij}` is the probability of selecting atom :math:`j` to
swap with atom :math:`i`.  Typically, a value for *R0* around the
average nearest-neighbor spacing is appropriate.  Since this is simply a
probability weighting, the swapping behavior is not very sensitive to
the exact value of *R0*.

The required *voro-ID* value is the compute-ID of a
:doc:`compute voronoi/atom <compute_voronoi_atom>` command like
this:

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

    compute compute-ID group-ID voronoi/atom neighbors yes

It must return per-atom list of valid neighbor IDs as in the
:doc:`compute voronoi/atom <compute_voronoi_atom>` command.

The keyword *types* takes two or more atom types as its values.  Only
atoms *I* of the first atom type will be selected.  Only atoms *J* of the
remaining atom types will be considered as potential swap partners.

The keyword *diff* take a single atom type as its value.  Only atoms
*I* of the that atom type will be selected.  Atoms *J* of all
remaining atom types will be considered as potential swap partners.
This includes the atom type specified with the *diff* keyword to
account for self-diffusive hops between two atoms of the same type.

Note that the *neighbors yes* option must be enabled for use with this
fix. The group-ID should include all the atoms which this fix will
potentially select. I.e. the group-ID used in the voronoi compute should
include the same atoms as that indicated by the *types* keyword. If the
*diff* keyword is used, the group-ID should include atoms of all types
in the simulation.

The keyword *ke* takes *yes* (default) or *no* as its value.  It two
atoms are swapped with different masses, then a value of *yes* will
rescale their respective velocities to conserve the kinetic energy of
the system.  A value of *no* will perform no rescaling, so that
kinetic energy is not conserved.  See the restriction on this keyword
below.

The *region* keyword takes a *region-ID* as its value.  If specified,
then only atoms *I* and *J* within the geometric region will be
considered as swap partners.  See the :doc:`region <region>` command
for details.  This means the group-ID for the :doc:`compute
voronoi/atom <compute_voronoi_atom>` command also need only contain
atoms within the region.

The keyword *rates* can modify the swap rate based on the type of atom
*J*.  Ntype values must be specified, where Ntype = the number of atom
types in the system.  Each value is used to scale the probability
weighting given by the equation above.  In the third example command
above, a simulation has 3 atoms types.  Atom *I*s of type 1 are
eligible for swapping.  Swaps may occur with atom *J*s of all 3 types.
Assuming all *J* atoms are equidistant from an atom *I*, *J* atoms of
type 1 will be 3x more likely to be selected as a swap partner than
atoms of type 2.  And *J* atoms of type 3 will be 6.5x more likely to
be selected than atoms of type 2.  If the *rates* keyword is not used,
all atom types will be treated with the same probability during selection
of swap attempts.


Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This fix writes the state of the fix to :doc:`binary restart files
<restart>`.  This includes information about the random number generator
seed, the next timestep for MC exchanges, and the number of exchange
attempts and successes.  See the :doc:`read_restart <read_restart>`
command for info on how to re-specify a fix in an input script that
reads a restart file, so that the operation of the fix continues in an
uninterrupted fashion.

None of the :doc:`fix_modify <fix_modify>` options are relevant to this
fix.

This fix computes a global vector of length 2, which can be accessed
by various :doc:`output commands <Howto_output>`.  The vector values are
the following global cumulative quantities:

  #. swap attempts
  #. swap accepts

The vector values calculated by this fix are "intensive".

No parameter of this fix can be used with the *start/stop* keywords of
the :doc:`run <run>` command.  This fix is not invoked during
:doc:`energy minimization <minimize>`.

Restrictions
""""""""""""

This fix is part of the MC package.  It is only enabled if LAMMPS was
built with that package.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>`
doc page for more info.  Also this fix requires that the :ref:`VORONOI
package <PKG-VORONOI>` is installed, otherwise the fix will not be
compiled.

The :doc:`compute voronoi/atom <compute_voronoi_atom>` command
referenced by the required voro-ID must return neighboring atoms as
illustrated in the examples above.

If this fix is used with systems that do not have per-type masses
(e.g. atom style sphere), the *ke* keyword must be set to *off* since
the implemented algorithm will not be able to re-scale velocities
properly.
