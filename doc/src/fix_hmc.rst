Description

.. versionadded:: TBD

This fix implements the hybrid or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)
algorithm.  The basic idea is to use molecular dynamics (MD) to
generate trial MC "moves" which are then accepted or rejected via the
Metropolis criterion.  In this context, an MC "move" is the new
configuration of particles after *N* MD steps, i.e. all the particles
in the system have moved to new positions. HMC generates a canonical
distribution in configuration space. More details on the theory behind
HMC can be found in the references, :ref:`(Mehlig) <Mehlig1>` and
:ref:`(Mehlig) <Mehlig2>`.

The details of the HMC algorithm for a repeating series of $N$ MD
steps are as follows:

(1) The configuration of the system is stored along with its current
total energy.  This includes all particle positions and velocities and other
per-atom properties (e.g. dipole orientation vector for particles with
dipole moments).

(2) The system is time integrated in the NVE ensemble for the
specified *N* MD steps and the new energy is calculated.  The new
configuration is the trial "move" to accept or reject.

(3) The energy change :math:`\Delta{H}` in the Hamiltonian of the
system due to the "move" is calculated by the following equation:

.. math::

   \Delta{H} = H(q',p') -  H(q,p)

The new configuration is then accepted/rejected according to the
Metropolis criterion with probability:

.. math::

   p^{acc} = min(1,e^{\frac{-\Delta{H}}{k_B T}})

where *T* is the specified temperature.

The idea of HMC is to use a timestep large enough that total energy is
*not* conserved. The change in total energy (the Hamiltonian) is what
the Metropolis criterion is based on, not the change in potential
energy.

(4) If accepted, the new configuration becomes the starting point for
the next trial MC "move". If *resample* is *yes* then the velocities are
resampled at this point as well.

(5) If rejected, the old configuration (from *N* steps ago) is
restored and new momenta (velocities) are assigned to each particle
in the fix group by randomly resampling from a normal distribution
at the specified temperature $T$ using the following equation:

.. math::

   p_{x,y,z} = \textbf{N}(0,1) \sqrt{\frac{k_B T}{2 m^2}}

The velocity-modified "old" configuration becomes the starting point
for the next trial MC "move".

.. note::

   HMC should be run with a larger timestep than would be used for
   traditional MD, which enables total energy fluctuations and
   generation of new conformations which MD would not normally generate
   as quickly.  The timestep size may also affect the acceptance ratio
   as a larger timestep will lead to larger and more extreme MC moves
   which are less likely to be accepted.  The timestep size must strike
   a balance between allowing the total energy to change and generating
   errors such as lost atoms due to atomic overlap.  This means that
   during the MD portion of the algorithm, unphysical dynamics will take
   place, such as large temperature fluctuations and large forces
   between atoms.  This is expected and is part of the HMC algorithm, as
   the MD step is not intended to produce a physically realistic
   trajectory, but rather to generate a new configuration of particles
   that can be accepted or rejected based on the Metropolis criterion.

.. note::

   High acceptance ratios indicate that the MC algorithm is inefficient,
   as it is not generating new configurations of particles any faster
   than MD would on its own. In the limit of an acceptance ratio of 1.0,
   the algorithm is equivalent to MD (with momentum resampling every *N*
   timesteps if *resample* = *yes*), and no benefit is gained from MC.
   A good rule of thumb is to aim for an acceptance ratio of 0.5 to 0.8,
   which can be monitored via the output of this fix.  This can be
   achieved by adjusting the *N* parameter and the timestep size.
   Increasing either of these values will increase the size of the total
   energy fluctuations, which can decrease acceptance ratio.  Increasing
   *N* will also increase the computation time for each MC step, as more
   MD steps are performed before each acceptance/rejection decision.  As
   noted above, increasing the timestep too much can lead to LAMMPS
   errors due to lost atoms or bonds, so both of these parameters should
   be chosen carefully.

.. note::

   This fix is designed to be used only for constant NVE simulations.
   No thermostat or barostat should be used, though LAMMPS does not
   check for this.  A :doc:`fix nve <fix_nve>` command must be defined
   to perform time integration for the MD portion of the algorithm.  See
   the explanation of the *rigid* keyword below for an exception when
   rigid bodies are defined.  Also note that only per-atom data is
   restored on MC move rejection, so anything which adds or remove
   particles, changes the box size, or has some external state not
   dependent on per-atom data will have undefined behavior.

----------

The keyword/value options are as follows:

The *rigid* keyword enables use of HMC for systems containing a
collection of small rigid bodies, with or without solvent (atomic
fluid or non-rigid molecular fluid).

The *rigidID* value should be the ID of a :doc:`fix rigid/small
<fix_rigid>` or :doc:`fix rigid/nve/small <fix_rigid>` command which
defines the rigid bodies.  Its integrator will be used during the MD
timesteps.  If there are additional particles in the system,
e.g. solvent, they should be time-integrated by a :doc:`fix nve
<fix_nve>` command as explained above.

The *resample* keyword determines whether velocities are also
resampled upon acceptance in step (4) above, in addition to step (5).
If *resample* = *yes*, velocities are resampled upon acceptance.  If
*resample* = *no* (default), velocities are not resampled upon
acceptance.

The *mom* keyword sets the linear momentum of the ensemble of
particles each time velocities are reset in steps (4 or 5) above.  If
*mom* = *yes* (default), the linear momentum of the ensemble of
velocities is zeroed. If *mom* = *no*, the linear momentum of the
ensemble of velocities is not zeroed.

----------

This fix creates several additional computes for monitoring the energy
and virial of the system and storing/restoring the system state.  This
is done internally, as if these commands had been issued, where ID is
the ID of this fix:

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   compute hmc_ke_ID all ke
   compute hmc_pe_ID all pe
   compute hmc_peatom_ID all pe/atom
   compute hmc_press_ID all pressure NULL virial
   compute hmc_pressatom_ID all stress/atom NULL virial

The output of these computes can be accessed by the input script,
along with the other outputs described in the next section.

Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

No information about this fix is written to :doc:`binary restart files
<restart>`.  None of the :doc:`fix_modify <fix_modify>` options are
relevant to this fix.

This fix calculates a global scalar and global vector of length 5,
which can be accessed by various :doc:`output commands
<Howto_output>`.  The scalar is the fraction (0-1) of attempted MC
moves which have been accepted.  The vector stores the following
quantities:

* 1 = cumulative number of accepted moves
* 2 = cumulative number of rejected moves
* 3 = change in potential energy for last trial move
* 4 = change in kinetic energy for last trial move
* 5 = change in total energy (kinetic + potential energy) for last trial move

These values are updated once every *N* timesteps.  The scalar and
cumulative counts are "intensive"; the three energies are "extensive"
and are in energy :doc:`units <units>`.

No parameter of this fix can be used with the *start/stop* keywords of
the :doc:`run <run>` command.  This fix is not invoked during
:doc:`energy minimization <minimize>`.

""""""""""""

This fix is part of the MC package and requires the RIGID package to
be installed. It is only enabled if LAMMPS was built with both
packages.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` doc page for
