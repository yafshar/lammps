/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Cannot open dump file %s

The output file for the dump command cannot be opened.  Check that the
path and name are correct.

E: Too much per-proc info for dump

Number of local atoms times number of columns must fit in a 32-bit
integer for dump.

E: Dump_modify format line is too short

UNDOCUMENTED

E: Could not find dump custom compute ID

Self-explanatory.

E: Could not find dump custom fix ID

Self-explanatory.

E: Dump custom and fix not computed at compatible times

The fix must produce per-atom quantities on timesteps that dump custom
needs them.

E: Could not find dump custom variable name

Self-explanatory.

E: Region ID for dump custom does not exist

Self-explanatory.

U: Dump_modify format string is too short

There are more fields to be dumped in a line of output than your
format string specifies.
